## Description

This program is designed to "remove" myself, Henry Paul, from whatever scene is currently going on in front of my computer's camera. It does this by comparing the color of each pixel against a certain defined range, which I have set as an approximation of my skin tones, and then not drawing those pixels that fall within the range. In an attempt to not create issues with different skin tones, and any ethical issues that arise from that, I have decided that the program is designed to specifically target me; however, it may work on others.  

The program also has a white-balance adjustment feature for optimal results. Simply hit Enter or Return while the program is running and the picture will be updated based on the difference between pure white and the center-most pixel. Thus, if you hold a blank sheet of paper in front and the center of the camera and hit adjust, you should get a more accurate color reproduction, which greatly improves the "erasure".

The concept behind this project is to "remove" me from the situation, forcing one to look at the other things going on around in the camera. Normally, when you look in a mirror, you are focused solely on yourself; you look in a mirror to see your face, and the stuff around you is unimportant. By turning this concept on its head, I believe I have created a mirror that is in some ways "useless" but in other ways new and revealing.
